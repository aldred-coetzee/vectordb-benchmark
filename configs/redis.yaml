  notes: "In-memory for all operations — reads, writes, and searches happen in RAM. RDB snapshots can persist to disk for recovery but do not affect query/ingest performance. Benchmark runs without volume mount (fresh start each run). Numbers are representative of production since Redis is always memory-bound."
